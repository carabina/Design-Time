# Design Time!
#### A new phase of iOS development.

## What is this?
This is the repo for a talk that I, [Michael Helmbrecht](mrh.is), gave at the [SLUG meetup](http://www.meetup.com/swift-language/events/217652802/) in San Francisco. The video will be posted here ASAP.

The demo project is here under [Code](https://github.com/mrh-is/Design-Time/tree/master/Code) and the content for the talk is under [Talk](https://github.com/mrh-is/Design-Time/tree/master/Talk). The presentation was made with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/).
