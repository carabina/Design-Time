# Design Time!
#### A new phase of iOS development.

## What is this?
This is the repo for a talk that I, [Michael Helmbrecht](http://mrh.is/), gave at the [SLUG meetup](http://www.meetup.com/swift-language/events/217652802/) in San Francisco. The video is available [here](http://realm.io/news/the-12-apps-of-swiftmas/); I go on at 28:56.

The demo project is here under [Code](Code) and the content for the talk is under [Talk](Talk). The presentation was made with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/).
